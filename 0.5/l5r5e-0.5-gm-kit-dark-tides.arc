                ^"Role"        STRING "Potential villain: ambitious Tortoise smuggler"
                ^"Description" STRING "This Tortoise samurai is officially a merchant patron, sponsoring several ships that call Slow Tide Harbor their home port. In reality, of course, this means she is a smuggler—one of the most powerful here. She has been steadily and relentlessly building up wealth and influence through secret commerce in illegal drugs (both opium and exotic foreign ones), gaijin items, and stolen goods—the latter usually bought cheaply from pirates or bandit gangs. She is allied with Boss Kizo but she also has extensive and growing networks elsewhere in Rokugan. Her long-term goal is not just wealth, but political power, both within her clan and in the Empire as a whole. She nurses secret dreams of her clan becoming far more powerful, perhaps even ascending to the ranks of the Great Clans. Yumiko is a petite woman in her mid-twenties with a dueling scar along one cheek, her eyes glittering with ambition. In contrast to many of her fellow Tortoise samurai, who tend to dress little different from the peasants around them, she always wears proper samurai garb in the clan colors of green and black. She is unmarried and has no intention of changing that, an eccentricity that would be problematic in other clans but in the Tortoise Clan is of no great account.\n\nKasuga Yumiko is one of three potential villains in this adventure. If the GM selects her for the role, her motivation is the desire to boost her own power by spectacularly defeating a threat to the Empire: the mahō cult of Kitsu Sokori. She is funneling kidnapped samurai to Sokori until the time is ripe for her to swoop in, destroy the cult, and reap the political rewards. Since she herself must have this heroic role, she is very unhappy at the prospect of the PCs digging into things, and she tries to throw them off the scent or even frame them as incompetent. Yumiko's profile is on page 23."

                ^"Role"        STRING "Potential villain: desperate, declining crime lord"
                ^"Description" STRING "The man named Yaguro was once a formidable brawler who rose in the ranks of his gang through his ability to dispose of rivals in back-alley fights. Those glory days, however, are long past. Now he is an old man with slumped shoulders, thinning hair, and a potbelly, and his opium gang is losing ground to more aggressive rivals—namely Bosses Hana and Kizo. Hana is using Blue Flame to push him out of his core territories in the Wallow, while Kizo is pressuring him in the Merchant District. Some of Yaguro's gang members are starting to drift away, joining the rival groups or simply leaving. Yaguro spends all day in the back office of his main opium den, the Green Rest, smoking his pipe and obsessively watching entering customers. He has become increasingly desperate to find new sources of wealth. Most recently, he has stooped to selling bankrupt opium addicts to the gaijin to crew their boats—so far just peasants, but it is likely this will eventually escalate. Yaguro is one of three potential villains for the adventure. If the GM selects him for the role, he has already escalated to selling drug-addicted samurai to Kitsu Sokori (via her agent, the vile rōnin Gaku). Yaguro's profile is on page 21."

                ^"Description" STRING "This gaijin in his thirties has black hair and a thick beard. He normally resides in his ship, a gaijin vessel whose name translates (roughly) as Obedient Slave. Originally from the city of al-Bhagvar, located along the Sand Road of the Caliphate, he fled after a youthful life of crime and murder. He eventually wound up as the captain of the Slave, pursuing a career of mixed piracy, smuggling, and legitimate trade.\n\nBold and ambitious, Azif sails directly to Slow Tide Harbor rather than following the Tortoise Clan's preferred protocol of landing on the remote island of Kameyama Jima. This has paid off for him with considerable wealth and improved contacts. He has cultivated alliances with the town's officials and merchants, as well as with the crime lord Boss Hana. Azif is fluent in Rokugani as well as several gaijin languages including his native Nehiri. He is one of the two most powerful smugglers here, the other being Kasuga Yumiko.\n\nIn addition to more conventional smuggling, he also brings in gaijin pepper, selling it through the Tortoise networks and various fronts to the Daidoji Harriers and Scorpion shinobi. He's also smuggling in a substance called \"Blue Flame,\" created from a flowering plant unknown in Rokugan. It is a potent drug on its own, but when mixed with opium, it produces a more intense and ecstatic experience than pure opium does.\n\nAzif is one of three potential villains in this adventure. If the GM selects this option, Azif is simply pursuing another profitable venture: smuggling people on behalf of a customer (Kitsu Sokori) who is willing to pay quite well. After all, her horrid blood rites are only hurting Rokugani, not himself, his crew, or his distant people. Azif's profile is on page 22."

Her intention is to rendezvous with the smugglers' ship as it heads out of the lagoon, but once the PCs take action, she hangs back to observe. Sokori won't make an appearance until the PCs defeat the last ruffian and think their troubles are resolved. At the GM's discretion, Sokori may use one or two mahō techniques, such as Grip of Anguish and Incite Haunting, to interfere with the PCs' efforts to capture the smugglers' ship. She makes these checks using a Water Ring of 4 and a Theology skill rank of 3. It is not readily apparent where these attacks have come from, but PCs with a vigilance of 3 or higher can spot a distant figure on a boat far across the lagoon."

A rōnin of formidable skill and strength, he is here to ensure that the kidnapped samurai are collected and delivered to his mistress. He sometimes visits the opium dens to scout out potential kidnapping targets, and he coordinates with the local villain's ruffians to carry out the kidnappings. Aside from that, he keeps a low profile (necessary since his physical size and distinctive tattoo make him visually memorable). Very few people in Slow Tide Harbor know his name or who he works for.\n\nGaku lives in the inn Suitengu's Rest, but the PCs are likely to have a hard time tracking him down. From a story perspective, it is probably best for the PCs not to be able to find him until Act Three. However, if the PCs are stuck and unable to find their way to the warehouse, the GM may opt to let them stumble across Gaku somewhere in Dockside or the Wallow (but not in a proper bathhouse, as his tattoo would prevent him from being allowed admission). The PCs' best option is not to confront Gaku but instead to follow him: this can eventually lead them to the warehouse or to whichever of the local villains is in league with him. If they choose confrontation instead, he is insolently uncooperative, bluntly suggesting that he has protection and allies in Slow Tide Harbor who render him untouchable.\n\nGaku uses the Wicked Mahō-Tsukai profile, on page 318 of the Core Rulebook. He can additionally perform the mahō techniques of Grip of Anguish and Incite Haunting (see page 224 of the Core Rulebook)."

A family man, he is often seen cheerfully walking around town with his grandchildren. Beneath this charming façade, however, is a cold and calculating criminal. Kizo runs an assortment of protection rackets against the other businesses in this district. With the support of Kasuga Yumiko, he has also been making inroads into the opium racket as well.

Mikoto gives the appearance of being less intelligent—her lower lip tends to droop, and she speaks vaguely, sometimes losing the trail of a conversation. However, this outward behavior is more act than reality. She finds using this behavior to fool others makes it easier for her to get through life in Slow Tide Harbor.\n\nMikoto generally takes a leave-well-enough-alone attitude, avoiding stirring up trouble as long as everyone avoids disruptions and pays their bribes on time. Serious crimes, such as murder, are still investigated, though she chafes at having to deal with such interruptions to her routine. This keeps the clashes between the three major crime bosses at a nonlethal level, and it means she'll be thoroughly unhappy if the PCs start killing people as part of their investigation. She is also hostile to any PCs from the Crane Clan, although she knows better than to provoke a duel.\n\nIf needed, Mikoto uses the Seasoned Courtier profile, on page 313 in the Core Rulebook, but has the Detached demeanor."

His fingers and hands are ink stained, and his small room is full of loose pieces of paper, some of them with paintings, others blank.\n\nAmano habitually chews on a thin wooden pipe, even if it is empty. He is perpetually short on money; his only income comes from selling paintings to Kizo's shop, and his art is not particularly good. He is likely to appeal to the PCs to support his art and to Crane PCs specifically to show sympathy for a fellow Crane forsaken by fate. Getting information from Amano is not difficult, since he is eager to talk to anyone who shows the slightest sympathy for his plight.

Never particularly good at the traditional Scorpion methods of blackmail and manipulation, he suffers from a world-weary cynicism that he masks with wry humor.\n\nNaizu does have some knowledge of the secrets in Slow Tide Harbor, but much less than one might expect from a Scorpion. Knowing he is to live out his life without purpose, and burdened with doubts about his clan's lack of ethics, he simply does not care enough to ferret out secrets for their own sake. Naizu very rarely partakes of opium; seeing what it has done to so many in the town, he makes an extra effort to not fall to its lure. His greatest challenge in Slow Tide Harbor, however, is sheer boredom. As a result, he actively seeks out new people and friendships whenever possible.

        DESCRIPTION "Taimana Choryū, Slow Tide Harbor, is a thriving port town that is nonetheless one of the most obscure settlements in Rokugan. Although it is located only a short day's ride north of the Imperial City of Otosan Uchi, its existence is unknown to the vast majority of Rokugan's samurai. The Tortoise prefer to keep things this way, since Slow Tide is their major holding and the primary nexus for their smuggling activities. Those of other clans who visit or dwell in Slow Tide have sought it out deliberately, usually because they desire the illicit goods and services it offers.\n\nSlow Tide is built on a peninsula in a swampy, irregular lagoon that is itself an offshoot of the Bay of the Golden Sun. The town boasts about three thousand residents, making it by far the largest single Tortoise settlement (although quite small compared to the nearby metropolis of Otosan Uchi). The majority of those living here are peasants and Tortoise samurai, and the difference between the two can sometimes be hard for outsiders to notice. There are also gaijin here, whose presence the Tortoise authorities accept for the sake of improving their trade and smuggling networks. Many aspects of the Empire's laws are largely ignored within Slow Tide Harbor. Gaijin goods are freely available (and gaijin themselves are a not uncommon sight), and so are illicit domestic products such as opium. Even gaijin pepper (see the sidebar on page 7) can be acquired, though as this substance is so powerful and dangerous, even the Tortoise crack down on anyone involved in its trade—unless, of course, they themselves are behind it."

Opium and other drugs are not sold openly, however, as even the Tortoise tolerate only so much. Many food and herb vendors covertly still sell them or direct customers to opium dens on the Dockside or in the Wallow.\n\nPCs wishing to purchase some of these illicit items generally find they are quite expensive; there are no fixed prices for them, but the GM should set values that are just outside their reach. Most of the merchants serve as conduits between the smugglers and their customers.

There is also at least one vessel of distinctly foreign appearance, with a low-raking deck and a trio of masts with triangular sails; the locals behave as though this is nothing strange or exceptional. The buildings near the docks are a mixture of warehouses and businesses.

Known as the Wallow, the town's most disparaged aspects can found here—opium dens that operate openly, gaudy brothels that no honorable samurai would ever enter, the offices of predatory moneylenders, and inns that are little more than filthy hovels for the poor and hopeless. The name was originally an insult from a long-ago Crane Emerald Magistrate (\"this is where the scum come to wallow in their sins\") and was adopted by the residents as an ironic tribute.\n\nThose who come to Slow Tide in search of trade go to the Dockside or the Merchant District.

A skinny and almost desperately nervous older man scurries forward and greets you with clasped hands and a wide, slightly fixed smile, his head bobbing in repeated short bows. As he does so, a wooden shutter in the smoky back of the den slides open, briefly revealing a candlelit room and the silhouette of a slump-shouldered elderly man.

These monks also travel through the city daily to tend to the smaller shrines.\n\nThis shrine is dedicated to Jikoju, the Fortune of the East Wind. Since the eastern wind comes from over the sea, bringing with it mysteries from beyond the Empire, the Tortoise Clan finds this Fortune singularly important.

Investigations using invocations, rituals, or kihō can also be used to gather these or other suitable clues, at the GM's discretion. The warehouse belongs to whichever of the three potential villains the GM has selected as the true culprit, so if the PCs are already suspicious of that person, that can also push them to investigate this location. If the PCs are unable to find their way to the warehouse, the GM can allow them to catch a glimpse of the mysterious tattooed rōnin, Gaku, speaking with one of the villain's ruffians. Gaku then goes to a meeting with the designated villain while the lower-ranking criminals head for the warehouse.\n\nOnce the PCs decide to investigate the warehouse, it triggers a conflict scene and, hopefully, supplies the clues that lead the PCs on to Act Three. At this point, the tone of the adventure should still be one of the gradual unraveling of the truth, although the action at the warehouse offers a break from pure investigation.

The tone of the adventure now shifts completely into dramatic action, and the GM should adjust accordingly, emphasizing speed and excitement. The fate of four samurai is at stake; further, the PCs begin to realize that this may involve not merely crime or drugs but also mahō. Based on their investigation at the warehouse, the PCs should be aware that the villain is preparing to ship out the remaining kidnapped samurai via the sea. If the villain is Azif, the planned shipment is on his ship, Obedient Slave. If the villain is Yaguro or Kasuga Yumiko, the shipment is being transported on a hired smuggler's ship (Floating Destiny or Jealous Zephyr, respectively). If the PCs did not find the clues in Act Two that identify which ship is taking the prisoners, all is not lost.

After his father forbade him to indulge his shameful addiction within their home, he fled to an obscure and disreputable town called Slow Tide Harbor. He stayed at the Inn of Many Paths and he occasionally sent his father letters. In these, he claimed he was using the false name of Doji Hiroshige (so as not to bring shame upon the Otomo name) and he also frequently begged for money to pay his debts. Eventually Saneda tired of his son's behavior and dispatched a trusted retainer to fetch the young man back to Otosan Uchi. However, when the retainer arrived at the inn, the innkeeper claimed not to have seen Hiroshige for over a week (and she since has been trying to collect his unpaid rent)."

Otomo Saneda does not trust them to find his son, preferring instead to call on the honorable services of the Emerald Magistrates. At the GM's option, Hiroka may also warn the PCs that the Tortoise Clan has the protection of the Emperor himself, making it difficult for Saneda to bring direct pressure to bear on it."

It seems to be fairly well maintained but is plain and unimpressive compared to the sort of establishment where an Imperial noble would normally stay. There is no garden and no stable. The door is open, with a curtain screening the top third of the doorway.\n\nWhen you brush the curtain aside and enter the common room, you see an assortment of worn tables and chairs, about half of them occupied by what appears to be a jumbled mix of samurai and peasants—it is difficult to be sure. A portly, middle-aged commoner is setting cups and bowls in front of customers; she pauses to bow at you, her face set in an impassive blank. \"Welcome, honorable samurai. Do you need food? A room?\"\n\nAt the most basic level, Chiyu can confirm that Hiroshige stayed at the inn for about four months. He was frequently behind on his rent, but since he was a Great Clan samurai, she did not throw him out as she would have done with a Tortoise or a commoner. He did get money periodically: some apparently sent by his family, some won in gambling, and some borrowed locally. He disappeared a little over two weeks ago."

        DESCRIPTION "The interior walls of the warehouse are lined with large wooden crates, stacked up to three deep and taking up a large part of the floor space. There is a modest open space by the main entrance (which is where the gang members normally hang out), and narrow passages between the crates that lead to the back walls and the two smaller doors. In the back of the warehouse is another open space, where the prisoners were held. Some of the crates have false inventory documents (stamped with the mon of the harbormaster) identifying which ship brought them into Slow Tide Harbor: Obedient Slave (Azif's ship), Floating Destiny (Yaguro's hired smuggling ship), or Jealous Zephyr (the smuggling ship Yumiko is using). These documents are direct clues regarding which ship is about to transport the prisoners, and thus the identity of the adventure's villain.\n\nOnce pried open (a TN 2 Labor or Fitness check), the crates reveal numerous illicit goods inside. There are plenty of dark-brown blocks wrapped in linen bags to protect and conceal them during transport; a TN 1 Medicine or Skulduggery check is needed to realize that these are raw opium. The other goods depend on which villain the warehouse belongs to, as follows:\n\nAzif: Gaijin items from the Ivory Kingdoms (intense spices, exotic jewelry, art that includes images of Ivindi gods and animals, saris, kukri knives, etc.), and the Blue Flame drug, which takes the form of a blue powder stored in small leather bags.\n\nBoss Yaguro: Nothing but opium, albeit of very high quality.\n\nKasuga Yumiko: Gaijin items from across the Sea of Amaterasu such as leather-bound books, forks and spoons, rapiers, and fancy glassware.\n\nThe holding area in the back of the warehouse contains clear and abundant evidence that prisoners were being kept there up until very recently. PCs with a vigilance of 2 or higher notice sets of iron manacles attached to the wooden wall with thick iron staples; all of the manacles show dried blood, bits of skin, and other evidence. There are also several chamber pots and water canteens, and the remnants of simple meals (barley, rice balls, dried fish, etc.)."

        TYPE "Combat"
        LOCATION #dockside_439cece03db8
        DESCRIPTION "The PCs arrive at the docks to find that the designated ship is about to cast off. The prisoners are already secreted away in the ship's cargo hold. Gaku is aboard the vessel as well, ready to take them away to his mistress to be sacrificed. The crew are casting off the mooring ropes, pulling up the gangway, and putting out oars to row the ship away from the dock and through the lagoon.\n\nIn contrast to the fight in Act Two, this battle should pose a serious threat to the PCs' safety. Aside from Gaku and the adventure's main villain, there should be a large number of their supporting fighters. The GM should include a number of Tortoise samurai and gaijin smugglers such that the total encounter rank for the scene is equal to or slightly exceeds the group rank of the PCs (see page 310 of the Core Rulebook).\n\nOnce the PCs get aboard the smugglers' ship, they have to face Gaku. The rōnin cultist initially fights the PCs in a conventional manner; he is a formidable swordsman and should be a serious threat for any PC. If the battle is going badly, though, Gaku does not hesitate to use mahō. He never willingly surrenders, and he fights to the death if possible. However, clever PCs may be able to use a TN 3 Command (Air 2, Earth 1) or Courtesy (Fire 4) check to get him to shout out a few bits of useful information during the fight, such as the name of his master, Kitsu Sokori. This may also happen if he unmasks during the fight. Fanning the Flames and other shūji can achieve similar results as well.\n\nIf the PCs are winning too easily, Gaku can set the ship on fire to drive them away. This might also happen through a combat misstep, invocations, or accidents involving a lantern. This imposes a \"clock\" on the fight, as the PCs must try to get belowdecks, free the prisoners (they are chained up and Gaku has the keys), and drag them out before the ship is engulfed. The GM can adjust the fire to increase or lessen tension during the battle, or even introduce storms to add additional environmental factors."

    SCENE ^"Conclusion and Epilogue" #conclusion_6a38a38f03e4 {
        TYPE "Montage"
        LOCATION #slow_tide_a893670aab1e
        DESCRIPTION "The PCs have solved the mystery of the missing samurai in Slow Tide Harbor and have prevented terrible blood rites from occurring, but that isn't the end of the story. The GM should use the way the events played out and how the PCs acted to carry their campaign narrative forward into new adventures."

        MONTAGE {
            MOMENT ^"The Tortoise Clan" {
                DESCRIPTION "The outcome of the investigation affects the Tortoise Clan, no matter who the local villain is revealed to be. Even if the Tortoise are not directly implicated, they face embarrassment for allowing these crimes to occur in their city. If Tortoise members were involved or were actually directing the crimes, the clan may well seek to scour its ranks against future internal villainy. Local officials may start pointing blame and divulging secrets regarding smuggling and other criminal operations to ensure they survive the aftermath. Lastly, and most importantly, if word reaches the Emperor, the Tortoise may face a penalty—something other clans may push for, as it might allow them to claim Tortoise lands as their own."
            }
            MOMENT ^"Slow Tide Harbor" {
                DESCRIPTION "The various other powers in the town are also affected. Outsiders might pay more attention to the port, something residents will not welcome. Shakeups might also install new major players in the town or introduce new criminal groups to replace those removed or eliminated in the turbulence."
            }
            MOMENT ^"Kitsu Sokori" {
                DESCRIPTION "The PCs have gained a powerful new nemesis in this vile mahō-tsukai. She can show up in future adventures, possibly again pulling the strings from the shadows such that the PCs might not be aware of her activity for some time. While she is upset that they stalled her plan to use the kidnapped samurai in powerful blood sacrifices, she might find the PCs interesting and attempt to lure them to her service. She is certain to keep tabs on them regardless, so that when she faces them she will be better prepared—and perhaps even know some of their specific weaknesses. She might also attempt to move her operations to another location, where she can perform even more terrible deeds."
